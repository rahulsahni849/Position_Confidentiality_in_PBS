Algorithm 1: Position Recognition.

1: Input: User’s Real time position using GPS.

2: Output: Recognized position ( cloacked region ).

3: UsersList UL ←− NULL

4: Analyzing Real Time users cloacked region

5: Get Remote users until n and add to UsersList

6: After n users found return a message to neighbours n.

7: CloakedRegion CR ←− NULL

8: Evaluate each NeighborUser n appeared in
UserList UL

9: Analyzing Target user's neighbours and determining their cloacked regions

10: Detect and calculate
CloakedRegion CR of the target user on the
basis of AnonymityThreshold k.

11: for n in neighbours do
Position ←− DecisionTree(n)
knn_train(Position)

12: RegionName ←− knn.predict(targetUser)

13: return RegionName
