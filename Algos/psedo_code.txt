Algorithm 1: Position Recognition.

1: Input: User’s Real time position using GPS.

2: Output: Recognized position ( cloacked region ).

3: UsersList UL ←− NULL

4: Analyzing Real Time users cloacked region

5: Get Remote users until n and add to UsersList

6: After n users found return a message to neighbours n.

9: CloakedRegion CR ←− NULL

10: Evaluate each NeighborUser n appeared in
UserList UL

11: Analyzing Target user's neighbours and determining their cloacked regions

12: Detect and calculate
CloakedRegion CR of the target user on the
basis of AnonymityThreshold k.

13: for n in neighbours do
Position ←− DecisionTree(n)
knn_train(Position)

14: RegionName ←− knn.predict(targetUser)

15: return RegionName
